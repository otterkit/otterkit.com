# Getting Started with Otterkit COBOL

Warning: The Otterkit compiler is not yet production ready. We do not recommend using it in a production environment until the codebase is more mature and stable!

## Otterkit COBOL Hello World

Here's an example of a basic Hello World program in COBOL.

```cobol

       identification division.
         program-id. hello-world.
       procedure division.
         display 'Hello, World!'.
         stop run.

```

COBOL has an most English-like syntax making it easy to read and
understand what it's trying to accomplish. In the next section
we'll show how you can compile and run this Hello World example.
